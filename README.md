# cfdmsh

Python library for the Salome Platform.

**WARNING:** The original, official version support was stopped in 2016.

Don't hesitate to fork this repo to update/extend the code. This repo is not supposed to be updated anymore.

**HOW-TO:**
The repo contains part of the original (dead) tougeron-cfd.com website hosting the library, were a download link can be found as well as the documentation and tutorials.
